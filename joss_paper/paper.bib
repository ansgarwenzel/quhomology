        abstract = {In this thesis we present a range of different knot theories and then generalise them. Working
with this, we focus on biquandles with linear and quadratic biquandle functions (in the quadratic
case we restrict ourselves to functions with commutative coefficients). In particular, we
show that if a biquandle is commutative, the biquandle function must have non-commutative
coefficients, which ties in with the Alexander biquandle in the linear case.

We then describe some computational work used to calculate rack and birack homology.}
